const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
// this allows us to create a schema for our use model.
// schema says 'I expect model to have properties and the data we expect those properties to be'

// Model represents all of the data in a single collection in our mongo database
// once we create the model, mongoose will create a collection in our data
